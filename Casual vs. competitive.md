# Casual vs. competitive

For me, the biggest flaw of the Commander format is that I can't sit down with a group of players outside my regular group and be assured of a fun game. The problem is that there is a yawning gap between the format defined by the Commander rules (what you are *allowed* to play) and the types of decks and strategies that different players actually *want* to play.

## The problem with power levels

Frequently people will try to draw distinctions between casual and competitive Commander. Frequently, these distinctions focus on power level. The idea is that we can slot decks into power levels and create fun games when people play in a pod with all decks at the same level. 

This idea has a few problems. One is that Magic is so flexible that power levels are very difficult to define. One can focus on fundamentals like quality of ramp and draw, utilization of the strongest strategies like instant win combos, or inclusion of broken individual cards. Power levels have to be fine-grained enough to bring decks to the same place but coarse-grained enough so that players can actually maintain decks at different levels. 

However, the larger problem with focusing on power levels is that they look at the casual vs. competitive divide as a power divide when in reality casual and competitive are two *different axes* along which you can optimize your deck. 

## Competitive

The competitive mindset is easy to define. With a competitive approach, deckbuilding is effectively an extension of gameplay. Your goal is to win, so you should come prepared with the strongest deck you can. 

This might mean a cEDH deck, but it doesn't have to because everything is relative. If you bring your decks to the edge of what your playgroup will tolerate strength-wise, you are using a competitive mindset. If you try to build a deck at the top of a particular power level, that is a competitive mindset. If your main goal in deckbuilding is winning more often, that is a competitive mindset.

## Casual

In contrast, casual players first and foremost want to create a fun game. Competitive players obviously want to have fun as well, but they take for granted that the game will be fun when played competitively (which it can be but often isn't; even cEDH players have designed alternate formats).

For a casual player deckbuilding is a *game design* concern. Game players try to win; game designers try to make playing fun and interesting. Of course, Magic has actual game designers who create the cards and write the rules. But, the fact that deckbuilding drastically shapes the experience of the game means that each player also has substantial agency in this. 

## Casual vs. competitive gameplay

As a final note, the above focuses on casual vs competitive *deckbuilding*. A comparable divide exists in gameplay, but it is much smaller and in general less controversial.

For example, a casual approach to gameplay means considering allowing take-backs, keeping players in the game even when it is sub-optimal to do so, or making the "cool" play even when it isn't the best play.

If you build a "good" casual deck, you can play it optimally and you'll be unlikely to ruffle any feathers. However, taking casual approach to gameplay cannot compensate for playing a competitive deck at a casual table. Leaning heavily into playing sub-optimally to avoid dominating the game too much just feels patronizing.
