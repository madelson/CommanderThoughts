# Restricted Commander

Restricted commander is a sub-format of Commander with the goal of raising the odds that players with different expectations, interests, and deck-building philosophies can enjoy a game of Commander together compared to the default format rules. We attempt to achieve this through a greatly-expanded and more opinionated banned and restricted list. 

## What does it mean for a card to be restricted? Isn't Commander already a singleton format?

"Restricted" in other formats means that you can only play one copy of that card in your deck instead of the usual four. That doesn't apply in Commander.

Instead, the meaning of restricted here is:
- You can play at most one card from the restricted list in your deck
- You cannot play restricted cards as your commander or companion
- If you are playing a restricted card, you must tell the other players which one it is upon revealing your commander (this is both to discourage cheating as well as to allow opponents to prepare for particularly nasty spells).

## Why use the restricted concept?

Bannings are frustrating because they will always upset some players who built decks around or purchased the now-banned card. In contrast, restrictions upholds the idea that Commander is a format where you can play most of the cards in your collection and in Magic's history. Some of the cards on the restricted list can be very frustrating to play against, and for many players make the game less fun overall. The hope is that by restricting to one such card per deck the impact of these cards on the format is greatly reduced.

The inclusion of Sol Ring in this list means that there is one very powerful restricted card that is widely accessible and fits into essentially any deck. As a result, no one should feel disadvantaged because their deck doesn't have a restricted card.

## What should a banned & restricted list try to achieve?

Because of the huge variety of cards and strategies available, it isn't feasible to use bannings and restrictions to reach a format where any four players can sit down together and enjoy a fun and balanced game. However, this list does attempt to bring the format closer to that ideal than where it is with the official banned list.

Unlike the official list, this list does not use bannings and restrictions as "examples" of types of cards players should avoid. However, like the official list it does not attempt to define exactly what should be acceptable or fun for any player.

## What qualifies a card for being banned or restricted?

This list attempts to rein in:
  - The most innately powerful strategies (e. g. combo) to allow for a broader diversity of strategies and cards
  - Generically-powerful staples encourage a broader set of cards to be played and reduce repetitive gameplay
  - Effects that frequently result in non-games or less-fun games

## B&R List

### Already-banned cards

For compatibility, any card banned in the [official B&R list](https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/banned-list/) is banned in Restricted Commander. A number of these cards probably could be restricted instead, but it is simpler to just ban them.

### Fast Mana

These cards give you a huge leg up on mana early in the game compared to the alternatives. The fact that many of these are both colorless and expensive makes them an easy way for players to "pay for performance". 
- Sol Ring
- Mana Crypt
- Jeweled Lotus
- Carpet of Flowers
- Mox Emerald
- Mox Jet
- Mox Pearl
- Mox Ruby
- Mox Sapphire
- Mana Vault
- Lion's Eye Diamond
- Gaea's Cradle
- Serra's Sanctum
- Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary
- Mana Drain

Banned:
- Channel
- Black Lotus
- Fastbond
- Tolarian Academy

### Exploits the format rules

These are cards which are particularly strong in commander, often because they exploit either the multiplayer nature of the format or the high starting life total.

- Cyclonic Rift
- Smothering Tithe
- Rhystic Study
- Mystic Remora
- Lutri, the Spellchaser
- Griselbrand
- Leovold, Emissary of Trest

- Dockside Extortionist

Banned:
* Erayo, Soratami Ascendant
* Karakas
* Limited Resources
* Trade Secrets
* Prophet of Kruphix

### Cheap Tutors

Tutors decrease the variance of gameplay and offset the drawbacks to playing combo in a singleton format. This list focuses on the most efficient tutors, which typically have very low mana values or cover the mana value of the card being searched for by putting it directly onto the battlefield.

- Demonic Tutor
- Demonic Consultation
- Tainted Pact
- Imperial Seal
- Sylvan Tutor
- Mystical Tutor
- Worldly Tutor
- Enlightened Tutor
- Gamble
- Crop Rotation
- Personal Tutor
- Diabolic Intent
- Natural Order
- Gifts Ungiven
- Eladamri's Call
- Altar of Bone
- Merchant Scroll
- Time of Need
- Entomb
- Survival of the Fittest
- Protean Hulk
- Chord of Calling
- Finale of Devastation
- Birthing Pod
- Prime Speaker Vanifar
- Green Sun's Zenith
- Primeval Titan
- Academy Rector
- Arena Rector

Banned:
* Tinker

### Good Fetches

Why: get around color identity, make 3+ color manabases too easy, good with landfall, good with land recursion, banned in Conquest

- Arid Mesa
- Bloodstained Mire
- Flooded Strand
- Marsh Flats
- Misty Rainforest
- Polluted Delta
- Scalding Tarn
- Verdant Catacombs
- Windswept Heath
- Wooded Foothills

### Easy Combo

While there are many, many ways to achieve an instant win through combos, these cards are some of the most efficient and flexible.

- Ashnod's Altar
- Phyrexian Altar
- Krark-clan Ironworks
- Aetherflux Reservoir
- Underworld Breach
- Aetherflux Reservoir
- Primal Surge
- Flash
- Omniscience
- Food Chain

Banned:
- Paradox Engine

### Denial

These cards often result in many turns in which players cannot do anything, often through efficient mana denial or a total game reset.

- Static Orb
- Winter Orb
- Stasis
- Sundering Titan
- Braids, Cabal Minion
- Iona, Shield of Emeria

Banned:
- Balance
- Shahrazad
- Upheaval
- Worldfire

### You win the game

"You win the game" cards allow decks to ignore the challenge of dealing 120 damage or getting through your opponents' defenses. Many of these cards are balanced for 2-player, 60-card formats and the hoops they make you jump through are not terribly difficult in commander games. The cards that are banned have win conditions that are particularly easy to achieve. The presence of cards like this in a meta allows decks to be less proactive and include far fewer threats, leading to less dynamic gameplay.

- Felidar Sovereign
- Helix Pinnacle
- Revel in riches
- Biorhythm
- Mechanized Production
- Test of Endurance
- Simic Ascendancy
- Approach of the Second Sun

Banned:
- Coalition Victory
- Jace, Wielder of Mysteries
- Laboratory Maniac
- Thassa's Oracle

### Extra Turns

Extra turns frequently lead to one player dominating gameplay for a long time in a way that is rarely fun for others. Even worse, there is a strong strategic incentive to chain these cards together.

- Alrund's Epiphany
- Beacon of Tomorrows
- Gonti's Aether Heart
- Karn's Temporal Sundering
- Medomai the Ageless
- Nexus of Fate
- Notorious Throng
- Part the Waterveil
- Ral Zarek
- Sage of Hours
- Teferi, Master of Time
- Temporal Tresspass
- Timestream Navigator
- Temporal Mastery
- Temporal Manipulation
- Time Stretch
- Walk the Aeons
- Expropriate
- Alrund's Epiphany
- Alchemist's Gambit

Banned:
- Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
- Time Vault
- Time Walk
- Capture of Jingzhou
- Time Warp
- Time Sieve

### Original Duals

Restricted mainly due to their scarcity and price combined with the fact that any nearly any deck that could play them would play them.

- Badlands
- Bayou
- Plateau
- Savannah
- Scrubland
- Taiga
- Tropical Island
- Tundra
- Underground Sea
- Volcanic Island

### Raw Strength 

This catch-all category includes cards which are much more powerful than the alternatives and have a huge (but not necessarily fun) effect on gameplay. The bix X spells are notable for there ability to kill everyone from 40 life for much less mana than the alternatives. The cheap wheels are easy to abuse and incidentally disruptive to gameplay by resetting everyone's hands. The Eldrazi titans limit deck variety by frequently being the best "big fattie" options regardless of color identity.

- Torment of Hailfire
- Crackle with Power
- Debt to the Deathless
- Windfall 
- Wheel of Fortune 
- Time Twister 
- Time Spiral 
- Echo of Eons
- Kozilek, Butcher of Truth
- Kozilek, the Great Distortion
- Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger
- Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre
- Doubling Season
- Craterhoof Behemoth
- Panoptic Mirror

Banned:
- Recurring Nightmare
- Ancestral Recall

### Oddities

These are banned on the traditional commander list. Included for completeness.

Banned:
- Ante cards

- Conspiracies
