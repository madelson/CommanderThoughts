# Optimizing for casual

Building a *casual* Commander deck means optimizing for fun gameplay rather than win percentage. To build a casual deck, you must first be bought into this philosophy. But where to go from there?

What makes a game fun is obviously subjective. However, there are general game design principles that most people can probably agree on. Below, I've listed each principle along with deckbuilding actions that have a positive (➕) or negative (➖) influence on that dimension of the game. A deck doesn't have to include all positives with zero negatives, but a "good" casual deck should, in general, be heavily weighted towards positives. 

## Fairness 
Games are not fun if they are not fair. When each player is building their own deck, the game is always going to be unfair to some degree, although multiplayer dynamics help even things out a bit. Still, how you build your deck will heavily influence fairness. You should aim to create a situation where you wouldn't feel disadvantaged if you had to swap decks with an opponent. 
- ➖ Be wary of cards that incidentally hose some opposing decks, especially if they are hard to interact with (e. g. Back to Basics).
- ➖ Instant win combos which can ignore the added difficulty of 40 life and multiple opponents are the most powerful strategy available. Unless everyone is using this strategy, it will often feel unfair to opponents because it is simply better (from a *competitive* perspective) than what they are doing.

## Diversity
Games get less fun when they get stale. Magic fights this by having a huge set of cards to choose from and many unique interactions between cards. However, this doesn't matter if the same cards get played again and again (as happens in competitive eternal formats). You should aim for your deck collection to increase overall gameplay diversity.
- ➕ Niche cards, pet cards, wacky cards, and hidden gems all increase variety
- ➕ 2-color commanders tend to result in the most variety, followed by mono- and 3-color commanders. Four- and five-color commanders tend towards the least variety
- ➕ Focus on card interactions over strong individual cards
- ➕ Self-imposed deckbuilding restrictions (e. g. based on flavor) can greatly increase diversity
- ➖ Running the same impactful staples or win conditions leads to repeated gameplay across decks
- ➖ Tutors reduce variety within a deck and result in repetitive gameplay across games
- ➖ Some repeatable/recursive effects (e. g. eminence) can lead to repetitive gameplay

## Impact
The game is more fun when each player has a meaningful impact on the game. 
- ➕ Effects that support teamwork and temporary alliances make more players matter
- ➕ Board wipes and targeted interaction effects allow your deck to impact the game when not in the lead
- ➕ Strategies that enable aggression or favor bold proactive plays help a deck do something every time
- ➖ Instant win combos can make previous impact feel irrelevant
- ➖ "Glass cannon" decks either dominate the game or have little to no impact
- ➖ Strategies that eliminate one player early often result in a bad experience for that player
- ➖ Heavy "stax" effects may prevent players from having an impact on the game

## Choices
Games are more compelling they present players with interesting strategic choices and opportunities to outplay their opponents.
- ➕ Effects that can be used in different ways or offer many options (e. g. instants, charms, commands) allow for more choice
- ➕ Effects that support teamwork and temporary alliances create new options
- ➕ Attacking and blocking regularly creates many interesting choices
- ➖ "Stax" effects and excessive disruption can leave players with few or no options
- ➖ Non-interactive and/or sudden win conditions reduce the impact of choice (e. g. in the form of politics/threat assessment)

## Plot
Just like a good story has ups, downs, and unexpected twists, a game of Commander is more fun and memorable if the path to the conclusion is indirect.
- ➕ "Comeback" effects (e. g. board wipes) that can turn the tables keep games interesting even after one player takes the lead
- ➕ Effects that you get to play with are more interesting than effects that simply end the game
- ➖ One-shot kills don't provide an opportunity for the game to reverse course

## Time
Pretty much any game will become stale if it goes on for too long. On the other hand, it can be dissatisfying if a game ends before you get to do anything, especially if you are the only one knocked out.
- ➕ Threats that can close out the game at a reasonable speed help bring games to an end
- ➕ Effects that force or reward action (e. g. goad, monarch, discard) keep the game moving. In contrast, be wary of effects that discourage action (e. g. Grave Pact)
- ➖ Game reset effects (e. g. Armageddon, Warp World) will frequently yield longer games
- ➖ Extra turn effects or strategies that take very long turns can make games feel longer by drawing out the time between players' turns
- ➖ Tutors can lead to slow gameplay as you search for the perfect answer
- ➖ Excessive life gain can lengthen games
